//This class provides a log for various messages sent from the engine. 
//Each entry/line is given a prio level(default is information) and a string aswell as a timestamp.
//The string is copied to three places: Printed to the console(enables a user to check things without interrupting a session), copied to the memory of this class in a vector
// and finally, upon exit the vector of messages is written to a log-file in text format.
