Continued work on Unit_Functionality and some vector functions. Mainly added some different ways to manipulate velocity.
Also did some small work on rotation and continued implement move in basic_unit.
Did not do a build or commit, will wait with that until I feel that basic_unit is somewhat complete

Created Game_Entity which inherits from Game_Object and implements lifeTime, ID, ToC, position and health.
Did some research, all trig functions are available in std libs. I might write my own wrapper tho, undecided on that one.
Changed Basic_Unit to inherit from Game_Entity.
Next stop: Wrapping upp Basic_Unit and then start creating Node.

First entry

Created Basic_Unit

Realised I really need some basic physic & math functions. Going to check for it in sfml or math. If need be I'll implement by myself.
Some functions I know I'll need:
All trigs and antitrigs
Collisions
